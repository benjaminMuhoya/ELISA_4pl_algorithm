Calculating a 4PL Fit for the standard curve
Make sure your data is structured as in the example file 
column 1 has sample name
column 2 has the absorbance value of each sample
column 3 has the absorbance of the standards 
Column 4 is the absorbance of the standards (duplicate)
column 5 has the actual concentration of the compound in the standards 
Column 6 has the absorbance of the blank well in duplicate
